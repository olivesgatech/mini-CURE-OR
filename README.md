This repository contains the description and the link to a subsampled version of the original CURE-OR dataset. The goal of this project is to analyze the robustness of off-the-shelf recognition applications under multifarious challenging conditions, investigate the relationship between the recognition performance and image quality, and estimate the performance based on hand-crafted features as well as data-driven features. To achieve this goal, we introduced a large-scale, controlled, and multi-platform object recognition dataset CURE-OR, which stands for Challenging Unreal and Real Environments for Object Recognition. For more information about CURE-OR, please refer to our papers.

### Download Dataset
In the original CURE-OR dataset, there are 1,000,000 images of 100 objects with varying size, color, and texture, captured with multiple devices in different setups. In the sampled version, there are a total of 16,500 images in train and test sets distributed over ten classes. For each class, there exists training image samples for three backgrounds, five camera angles, 18 different challenge types, and 5 levels of challenge.

### Challenging Conditions Generation
Python Imaging Library (PIL) version 4.2.1 and scikit-image version 0.13.0 are utilized to generate challenging conditions. Salt and pepper noise is synthesized with scikit-image and all other challenging conditions are simulated with PIL. The minimum and maximum parameter values for each challenge type except dirty lens 2 and grayscale are provided below, and parameter values are linearly spaced between the two for different challenge levels.
<ul>
	<li>Resize: downsample with bicubic interpolation; the size of a new image is determined by multiplying pixel dimensions of an original image by factors linearly spaced between 1 (exclusive) and 0.5 (inclusive)</li>
	<li>Underexposure: brightness control with factors between 0.4 and 0.08</li>
	<li>Overexposure: brightness control with factors between 1.4 and 6</li>
	<li>Gaussian blur: radius of blur between 8 and 60</li>
	<li>Contrast: increase separation between dark and bright colors on spectrum by factors between 2 and 5</li>
	<li>Dirty lens 1: blends a single dirty lens pattern into an image with weights values between 0.2 and 0.65</li>
	<li>Dirty lens 2: overlays a distinct dirt pattern onto an image for each challenge level</li>
	<li>Salt & pepper noise: replaces random pixels of an image with either one or zero, with amount between 0.2 and 0.9</li>
	<li>Grayscale: convert an image into monochrome</li>
</ul>
